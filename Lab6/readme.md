# Internet Architecture
# Internet Protocol
  An IP address is a numerical label such as 192.0.2.1 that is connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. The differece between these two are that IPv4 addresses are written as a string of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots and IPv6 addresses are considerably longer strings of numbers, so they are written using hexadecimals, which can fit more information into fewer digits.
  ICANN was formed in 1998. It is a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation with participants from around the world dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable and interoperable. It promotes competition and develops policy on the Internet’s unique identifiers.
  # TCP/IP
   It is a network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers and other network communications hardware.
   The TCP/IP's responsibility is to give each computer or device a unique IP address. 
    The “Client” in a TCP/IP connection is the computer or device that “dials the phone” and the “Server” is the computer that is “listening” for calls to come in. In other words, the Client needs to know the IP Address of whatever Server it wants to connect to and it also needs to know the port number that it wants to send and receive data through after a connection has been established. The Server only has to listen for connections and either accept them or reject them when they are initiated by a client.
    It is possible to write a single protocol that takes data from one computer application and sends it to an application on another computer.- A Single stack Protocol. The problem with this approach is that it very inflexible, as any changes require changing the entire application and protocol software. The approach used in networking is to create layered protocol stacks. Each level of the stack performs a particular function and communicates with the levels above and below it.
 # Internet Security 
    HTTP is a protocol used for viewing web pages on the internet. The client request to the server, they both have a mutual connectiona and the server sends back a response.
    HTTPS is stands for secure hypertex transfer protocol. HTTP encrypts the data that's being retrieved by HTTP. It insures that all data being transferred over the internet between computers and servers is secure by making the data impossible to read. 
    # Securing your Internet Browser
    Not securing your web browser can lead quickly to a variety of computer problems caused by anything from spyware being installed without your knowledge to intruders taking control of your computer.
    Computer systems and software packages may be bundled with additional software, which increases the number of vulnerabilities that may be attacked.
