# Pursuing Computer Science, committed to academic excellence. Prompted and Prepared to implement diverse skill sets, 
# Learning computer science over the computer is very difficult and frustrating if you don’t have the patience for it. This entire semester, I’ve felt pretty hopeless. I get the obvious concept and I think it’s learnable really but then again it requires a lot of work to even just get close to furthering your career within this major. All of it’s not so bad though, Reading multiple articles gave a bit of insight on what I’m up against. Hopefully in the near future I can look back on this and laugh looking at my progress.
