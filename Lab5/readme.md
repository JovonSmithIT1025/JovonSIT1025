# Intro to Networking
# Data Transmission
Packet Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on the destination system.
IP Address - Unique identifying number
Protocol - Set of rules to allow devices to commuincate 
Packet - Unit of data
DNS - Directory of IP address commons names.
They all relate within eachother because they work with one another to power up the internet. 
# Networking Hardware 
A hub does not filter any data or has any intelligence as to where the data is supposed to be sent because the only thing a hub knows is when a device is connencted to one of it's ports. A switch is similar to a hub although it can learn the physical addresses of devices that it is connected to and stores the addresses called MAC addresses. 
Hub and switches are used to create networks, routers are actually used to connect networks. 
# Network Topolgies
If the central hub or switch fails then all the computers on that central point would be affected resulting to this, the entire network would be failed. 
In mesh technoogy, each computer on the network is connected to one another. Because it has all the connections to eachother, it handles failure pretty well. Due to mesh wireless being such a success, it's very expensive. Very much like the mesh wireless, infrastructure topology has devices that also connect to one another. I wouldn't say either of them are better than eachother but I will say that Infrastrucutre is probably more helpful considering that it's using mulitple devices such as tablets, cellphones and computers and not just computers by themselves like mesh.
