# LucidChart
Learning about lucidchart was a little confusing at first. However, after watching the video a few times it became more clearer. I can now see how lucid charts can be helful in the future. The video was short and got straight to the point. I am not able to understand the formatting of how lucid charts are displayed.
# Intro to Networking
# Network Design 
I think wireless printers are more convenient. Using a wireless printer you can print from multiple devices and from different places.  It's a more modern way of the way technology is used today. Wireless printers can even be assessed through your smart phone. I chose this design because i was intrigued by how printers have evolved. Many people are not aware how using a wireless printer can be used to share information on the go.
# NSA/CSS
The NSA is responsible for preventing and erdicating any and all threats to the U.S National security system. They're job is to focus on the defense industrial base.
# Data Transmission
Packet Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on the destination system.
IP Address - Unique identifying number
Protocol - Set of rules to allow devices to commuincate 
Packet - Unit of data
DNS - Directory of IP address commons names.
They all relate within eachother because they work with one another to power up the internet. 
# Networking Hardware 
A hub does not filter any data or has any intelligence as to where the data is supposed to be sent because With RBAC, instead of giving specific users access rights to an information resource, users are assigned to roles and then those roles are assigned the access. This allows the administrators to manage users and roles separately, simplifying administration and, by extension, improving security. only thing a hub knows is when a device is connencted to one of it's ports. A switch is similar to a hub although it can learn the physical addresses of devices that it is connected to and stores the addresses called MAC addresses. 
Hub and switches are used to create networks, routers are actually used to connect networks. 
# Network Topolgies
If the central hub or switch fails then all the computers on that central point would be affected resulting to this, the entire network would be failed. 
In mesh technoogy, each computer on the network is connected to one another. Because it has all the connections to eachother, it handles failure pretty well. Due to mesh wireless being such a success, it's very expensive. Very much like the mesh wireless, infrastructure topology has devices that also connect to one another. I wouldn't say either of them are better than eachother but I will say that Infrastrucutre is probably more helpful considering that it's using mulitple devices such as tablets, cellphones and computers and not just computers by themselves like mesh. 
# Cybersecurity and Encryption
The access control list identifies a list of users who have the capability to take specific actions with an information resource such as datast. . Specific permissions are assigned to each user such as read, write, delete, or add. Only users with those permissions are allowed to perform those functions.  The primary drawback is that each information resource is managed separately, so if a security administrator wanted to add or remove a user to a large set of information resources, it would be quite difficult. With RBAC, instead of giving specific users access rights to an information resource, users are assigned to roles and then those roles are assigned the access. This allows the administrators to manage users and roles separately, simplifying administration and, by extension, improving security
 The recipient receives the cipher text and decodes it (decryption). In order for this to work, the sender and receiver need to agree on the method of encoding so that both parties have the same message. In public key encryption, two keys are used: a public key and a private key. To send an encrypted message, you obtain the public key, encode the message, and send it. The recipient then uses their private key to decode it. The public key can be given to anyone who wishes to send the recipient a message. Each user simply needs one private key and one public key in order to secure messages. The private key is necessary in order to decrypt a message sent with the public key.
 Two people who have never met have agree on sharing a secret key without without letting another person who is always listening obtain another copy. 
# Cryptography 
Hi how are you - gh gnv zqd xnt
I put a ton of Z's in the beginning and the frequency rate for that letter shot up to red and had the highest rating. I think it would be the same for different languages, just different letters of course
A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets.

# Brute Force
A brute-force attack tries every possible decryption key for a cipher. Nothing stops a cryptanalyst from guessing one key, decrypting the ciphertext with that key, looking at the output, and then moving on to the next key if they didn’t find the secret message. Because the brute-force technique is so effective against the Caesar cipher, you shouldn’t actually use the Caesar cipher to encrypt secret information.  Kerckhoffs’s principle states that a cipher should still be secure even if everyone knows how the cipher works and someone else has the ciphertext.
